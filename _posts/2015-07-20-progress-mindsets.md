I've come to the conclusion that there are two ways to understand progress,
and that whichever way we choose to understand it,
will radically impact how we approach learning.

Let's explore the two understandings and their implications, by visiting one
of my favorite economists/philosophers.

### The Two Types of Progress

In _The Constitution of Liberty_ Hayek makes a distinction
between two types of progress:

1. Progress in connection with our individual endeavors. When we've set a fixed
aim and our measure of progress becomes our advancements towards our goal.
2. Progress as we see in social evolution. Progress as a process of learning
and adaptation, of trial and error. As a process where what we think is possible,
along with our values and desires, are constantly changing.

Contrast the two ways. In the first one, we know exactly what we're aiming for.
In the second one, progress becomes the discovery of the not yet known, and
therefore, its consequences are unpredictable; This is a much more general
understanding.

### The Two progress mindsets

Let's look at two examples:

1. A school with a set curriculum for Math, Literature, Writing, Science, etc.
Where the teacher lectures the students, asks them to be calm and quiet. Then,
tests them to measure how well they're learning the curriculum.
2. A school that has computers and internet, games, books, but no teachers
giving lectures or even commanding that a student does something. A school where
students choose what to learn and when to learn it.

The first school focuses on fixed learning goals, while the second one
forgets about goals and focuses on creating conditions favorable for learning.

### The Impact on How We Approach Learning

As you can see, both schools are radically different.

If we understand progress always leads into the unknown, the most we can hope
for is to understand how to create the conditions for it.

There's no question that each person on this earth is unique,
and has unique gifts and talents.
If what we're looking for in our education system
is not to drive everyone towards the same goal, as we would do in a factory,
we need to start understanding education as a process
that is rooted in trial and error,
where we're not pursuing one definite outcome. A process where each one of us
learns for learning's sake.
