##The Problem

Education can be fun and is much more effective when it is self-directed. Nevertheless, one of the biggest challenges that teachers and school administrators face with personalized learning is the amount of work that it requires to keep track of 30+ students each doing different things. 

Software can solve many of these information management problems and free up the teachers time to focus on what they do best: **encourage and challenge students**. The only problem is that often times, educators don’t have the budget, time, or knowledge to build the software that they need. 

##The Solution

This is the reason why Junto Studio will be launching in **August 3rd** the edTech Prize, a contest that gives you the chance to build software that will change education. 

##The end goal?
Building a platform that will make managing personalized learning in classrooms fun and easy for everybody involved. 

##The challenge:

Just follow this three simple steps:

1. Answer the question: What problem do you currently have in your classroom or school with managing self-directed learning, that you want to solve with software? (Max 500 words)

1. Give us a short example of this problem and what your ideal solution would be.

1. Submit a 2-min video of why this matters to you

##The judges:
Submissions will be assessed and scored by a panel with extensive experience in education and technology.

##The prize 
The selected project will work with the designers and developers at Junto Studio to build, design, and launch the solution in the fall of 2015 (up to 100k in value).
